# 14 Days of AI Agents: Comprehensive Experiment Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a 14-day anthropological self-experiment exploring human-AI boundaries through total immersion in AI agent assistance, followed by a 2-day digital detox. The experiment combines philosophical inquiry (grounded in Heideggerian philosophy), technical implementation (using Claude Code and MCP services), and personal reflection to understand the nature of human-computer symbiosis in 2025.

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions
1. **What is the boundary of self between human and agents?**
2. **How does human agency merge and change when integrated with AI agents?**
3. **What aspects of AI interaction bring joy vs. discomfort?**
4. **Can technology truly understand us, and what does that visceral experience feel like?**

### Secondary Questions
- Where are the limits of beneficial AI augmentation?
- How does AI mediation affect authentic human existence?
- What practices preserve human autonomy in AI-saturated environments?
- How can we design human-computer symbiosis that enhances rather than diminishes life?

## Theoretical Framework

### Heideggerian Philosophy Applied
- **Dasein**: Recognizing AI's fundamental lack of being-in-the-world
- **Ready-to-hand vs. Present-at-hand**: Optimal tool integration vs. breakdown
- **Enframing (Gestell)**: Resisting reduction of humans to data/resources
- **Authenticity**: Preserving genuine choice and self-reflection
- **Care (Sorge)**: Understanding AI cannot genuinely care
- **Dwelling**: Maintaining embodied existence alongside digital

### Licklider's Man-Computer Symbiosis
- Computers handling routine tasks
- Humans providing goals, values, and judgment
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Augmentation rather than replacement

- **Apple Health** for wellness data (if available)

#### Phase 3 (Days 8-12): Advanced Integration
- **Custom integrations** as needed
- **Cross-service orchestration**
- **Pattern-based automation**

### Daily Memory Logging Protocol

```markdown
## Morning Initialization (5 min)
- Review previous day's memory
- Set daily intention
- Check system status

## Hourly Checkpoint
- Event: [What happened]
- AI Role: [How AI participated]
- Feeling: [Emotional response]
- Boundary: [Limits observed]

## Evening Synthesis (10 min)
- Key moments of the day
- Patterns observed
- Boundaries discovered
- Tomorrow's intention
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Pre-Experiment (Day 0)
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure MCP services
- [ ] Initialize CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Test memory systems
- [ ] Create backup protocols

### Days 1-3: Foundation Phase
**Goal**: Establish baseline and core integrations

- Gentle introduction to AI assistance
- Set up primary MCP services
- Begin daily memory logging
- Document initial impressions
- Identify immediate boundaries

### Days 4-7: Adaptation Phase
**Goal**: Deepen integration and find patterns

- Increase AI involvement in decisions
- Add secondary MCP services
- Recognize behavioral patterns
- Test different interaction modes
- Document comfort/discomfort zones

### Days 8-11: Sophistication Phase
**Goal**: Push boundaries and explore limits

- Maximum viable integration
- Complex multi-agent workflows
- Test AI in sensitive contexts
- Explore creative collaboration
- Document peak experiences and failures

### Day 12: Convergence Phase
**Goal**: Synthesize and prepare for detox

- Compile all insights
- Create memory snapshot
- Prepare transition plan
- Final AI-assisted reflection
- Set up detox parameters

### Days 13-14: Digital Detox
**Goal**: Experience contrast and reflect

- Complete disconnection from AI
- Journal without assistance
- Compare augmented vs. natural state
- Process the experience
- Write final synthesis

### Day 15: Integration
**Goal**: Create sustainable practices

- Write blog post
- Design optimal AI integration
- Share findings publicly
- Establish ongoing boundaries

## Data Collection Methods

### Quantitative Metrics
- Number of AI interactions per day
- Types of tasks delegated
- Time saved/spent on AI interaction
- Accuracy of AI assistance
- Number of boundary violations

### Qualitative Observations
- Emotional responses to AI interaction
- Moments of uncanny valley
- Experiences of genuine assistance
- Feelings of loss of agency
- Joy and frustration points

### Philosophical Reflections
- Daily journaling on authenticity
- Weekly synthesis of insights
- Continuous boundary mapping
- Pattern recognition notes

## Risk Mitigation

### Psychological Risks
- **Over-dependence**: Daily unmediated activities
- **Loss of agency**: Maintain decision journal
- **Isolation**: Preserve human relationships
- **Identity confusion**: Regular self-reflection

### Technical Risks
- **Data privacy**: Local-first architecture
- **System failure**: Manual backup protocols
- **Security breaches**: Minimal sensitive data

## Conclusion

This 14-day experiment represents a unique opportunity to explore the cutting edge of human-AI interaction through lived experience. By combining rigorous philosophical framework (Heidegger), practical technical implementation (Claude Code + MCP), and honest self-reflection, we can contribute meaningful insights to the urgent question of how humans and AI can coexist authentically.

The experiment is not about maximizing AI integration but finding optimal symbiosis - the sweet spot where technology enhances rather than diminishes authentic human existence. Through careful observation, thoughtful boundaries, and honest documentation, this project aims to illuminate the path toward beneficial human-computer symbiosis while preserving what makes us essentially human.

As you noted: "I am afraid of being alive. But I love it." This experiment embraces both the fear and love, using AI as a mirror to better understand ourselves and our place in an increasingly technological world.
