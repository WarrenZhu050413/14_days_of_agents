**Modern Relevance:**
- Ideas reemerging in cognitive computing research
- Connection to extended mind theory and distributed cognition
- Recognition that true symbiosis requires complementary labor division and nonverbal communication

### Andy Clark's Extended Mind Theory

**Core Concepts:**
- Mind extends beyond brain/body into physical world through active externalism
- External objects function as part of cognitive processes when properly integrated
- Mind and environment act as "coupled system" forming complete cognitive system
- Challenges traditional human/machine boundaries

**Cultural Impact:**
- Reimagines human thought and identity in technological contexts
- Questions boundaries between brain and technology
- Relevant for understanding AI integration into cognitive processes

### Stiegler and Haraway: Technology, Identity, and Agency

**Bernard Stiegler - "Technical Beings":**
- Humans shaped equally by tools and biology
- Humanity's evolution co-determined by created technologies
- Technical objects as constitutive of human temporality and memory

**Donna Haraway - Cyborg Manifesto:**
- Rejection of rigid human/animal/machine boundaries
- Cyborg as metaphor for hybrid identities and fluid boundaries
- "The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment"
- Emphasis on responsibility for machines rather than domination by them

**Implications for AI:**
- Challenge binary thinking about human vs. machine agency
- Co-evolution and mutual constitution rather than simple tool use
- Identity as fluid and constructed through technological relations
