Save the current conversation's key insights and interactions to the experiment's memory system: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. **Create Daily Memory Entry**
   - Get today's date for the filename
   - Create/update the daily memory file at `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Log key events from this conversation with timestamps
   - Note interaction types, emotional tones, and significant moments
   - Record tasks completed and decisions made
   - Add observations about human-AI dynamics

2. **Update Long-Term Memory**
   - Check for new patterns or preferences discovered
   - Update user context files in `memory/context/`
   - Note any recurring themes or interests
   - Document important relationships or contexts mentioned

3. **Add Philosophical Reflections**
   - Create reflection entry in `memory/reflections/`
   - Note boundaries observed or tested
   - Record insights about agency and understanding
   - Document what brought joy vs discomfort in the interaction
   - Consider the authenticity of the support provided

4. **Specific Memory Points to Capture**
   - Technical accomplishments (e.g., Gmail MCP setup)
   - User preferences and working style
   - Communication patterns
   - Trust boundaries
   - Successful collaboration moments
   - Areas where AI support was most/least effective

5. **Format Entries Using Templates**
   - Use the Daily Log Entry format from CLAUDE.md
   - Include Pattern Recognition entries where applicable
   - Mark boundary considerations explicitly

IMPORTANT: Focus on capturing the essence of human-AI symbiosis observed in this session. Document both successful integrations and moments of disconnect to inform the 14-day experiment.
